# React - Cart page

This project is made for learning purposes. This is ongoing project that will have more features.

## Description

This is a cart page with products. Main purpose of this project is exercising and extending knowledge in React JS. Besides React JS, I'm using Bootstrap with my own SCSS.

## Working Features

* Add products to cart
* Coupon PROMO30 - decreases total amout for 30%

## Features I'll be adding through time

* Product discount - Add discount for certan products through coupon
* Wishlist
* Adding product using free API
* Glass UI
* Make order complete pop up
* Make seperate pages for products, cart and checkout using Routing
* Make light/dark mode

This is a plan for now but as I'll work on this project I believe I'll get more ideas which I'll be implementing. If you have any ideas, you are more than welcome to share them with me.
